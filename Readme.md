### Explanation:
1. **Library Imports**: Import necessary libraries (`networkx`, `community`, `matplotlib.pyplot`).
2. **Graph Creation**: Read the edge list from a file to create a graph `G`.
3. **Partitioning**: Use the Kernighan-Lin algorithm to partition the graph.
4. **Partition Printing**: Print the entire partition and each individual partition.
5. **Drawing Function**: Define a function to draw the communities using different colors.
6. **Community Drawing**: Call the function to visualize the communities.
7. **Modularity Calculation**: Calculate the modularity of the partition and print it.
8. **Partition Quality**: Calculate the partition quality and print it.
